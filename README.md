4. IF-ELIF-ELSE – Grade Classification
Write a program that asks the user to enter their exam score (0–100), and then prints a
message based on the score:
- 90 and above → "Excellent! You got an A."
- 80 to 89 → "Very Good! You got a B."
- 70 to 79 → "Good! You got a C."
- Below 70 → "You need improvement. You got a D."
Use: if, elif, and else

5. SWITCH-CASE – Day of the Week

6. Advanced IF-ELSE – Login and Access Control System
Write a program that simulates a simple login and access control system.
The user is asked to enter:
- A username
- A password
- A role (either "admin" or "user")

Based on the input:
- If the username is "manager" and the password is "admin@123" and the role is "admin" → print:
"Welcome Admin Manager! Full access granted."
- If the username is "manager" and the password is correct but the role is not "admin" → print:
"Access denied: Admin role required."
- If the username is "guest" and the password is "user@123" and role is "user" → print: "Welcome
Guest! Limited access granted."
- If the password is wrong → print: "Incorrect password. Try again."
- If the username is not recognized → print: "Unknown user."
Use: if, else if, and nested if
Bonus: Use logical operators (&&, ||) and nested blocks
